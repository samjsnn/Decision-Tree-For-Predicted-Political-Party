# Decision-Tree-For-Predicting-Political-Party
Decision Tree used for predicting affiliated political party based off previous voting patterns on various topics 

Implements a decision tree classifier. It loads data from a CSV file, splits the data into training and testing sets, builds a decision tree model based on the training data, and evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It also generates a learning curve by varying the training set size and plotting the corresponding accuracies. The results, including the evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and learning curve, are printed and displayed using the matplotlib library.
